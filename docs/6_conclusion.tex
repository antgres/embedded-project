\section{Conclusion}\label{summary}

The initial objective in chapter \ref{scope} has been successfully achieved. A system was implemented that allows the user to add sensors, actuators and AS-Pairs in a modular way. This information is stored in a database and displayed on a frontend.\\

Furthermore, the defined requirements in chapter \ref{req} were also successfully implemented. New AS-Pairs can be added via a UI on a website. The UI is simple and minimalistic. The frontend communicates with the backend and are coordinated with each other. The backend is scalable in the number of AS-Pairs and can communicate with them via any number of implemented interfaces. \\

The AS-Pair is scalable in the number of sensors and actuators which can be implemented. These communicate with the backend via MQTT. The interfaces of the AS-Pairs can be accessed via the frontend. Due to the selected system architecture, all components are separated from each other and thus simplify maintainability.\\

However, the system can be extended by some points in further versions. The frontend can extend the UI with further functions, such as deleting an AS-Pair and visualising the accumulated data in the database per AS-Pair. Furthermore, the communication paths between the three components needs to be encrypted, so that sensitive data cannot be intercepted, and the individual components need to be protected against attacks.
